# Lift-Simulator
An implementation of a lift algorithm in C#

As part of an extensive interview process I was put in the role of a Chief Engineer and tasked with designing a lift system for a fictional hotel called Medicine Chest.

The specification for the task was as follows:
• There are ten floors in the block
• The people working in the offices are distributed evenly across all floors
• People start arriving for work at around 8 AM, and everyone has gone home by 6 PM
• The lift needs only one external call button on each floor, instead of the usual up/down buttons. Inside the lift
should be a set of buttons to send the lift to a desired floor, as with any other lift
• The lift should have a maximum capacity of eight people at any given time

There was also an extension task to design a lift system for a new bigger hotel called the Riz Hotel. This was the spec for the extension:
• The hotel has 30 floors, and people are no longer distributed evenly across all of them. The ground and 15th
floors are much more popular, for example.
• The hotel would like four lifts installed instead of one.

My written solution included, explanations, pseudocode and UML diagrams. This can be seen in "Lift Solution.pdf"
